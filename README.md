Task 5: Formulate Questions and Implement Extraction Let's define a few example questions and how you might retrieve that information from MongoDB. These questions are based on the datasets you've uploaded.

    What are the total emissions reduction targets set by cities in 2017?
    Which cities have assessed their climate risk and vulnerability in 2023?
    List all emissions reduction targets set by cities in Denmark.
    What is the average emissions reduction target percentage across all cities?
    Identify cities with an emissions reduction target greater than 30%.
    How many cities have set their baseline year for emissions reduction before 2010?
    Extract all data related to cities' community-wide emissions for 2017.
    Find cities that have both emissions reduction targets and have assessed climate risk and vulnerability.
    List cities with emissions baseline years but no specific reduction targets.
    Which countries are most represented in the climate risk and vulnerability assessments?
